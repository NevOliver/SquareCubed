Hello world.  This repository contains my small game "Square Cubed".  At this point, I am new to using Installers to install my game.  
I am also new to using Websites to install my games as well.  Right now I'm just trying to get everything working.

To download the file, click on Square Cubed Setup, on the left, and then click on 'View Raw' to download the installer.

Because I am not a bigname publisher, your computer will probably freak out and think that I'm sending you a virus (IT's NOT A VIRUS...honestly it isn't...it'd be really bad for my business if it was).  

I haven't figured out how to get my installer bypass those kind of alerts, so you'll just have to manually get around them.

After you get your computer to install the game, click start and enjoy

Controls are 'A' to move Left and 'D' to move right.
